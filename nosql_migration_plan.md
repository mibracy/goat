## Migration Plan: MariaDB to NoSQL Implementation

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

1.  **Define Clear Objectives:**
    *   What specific problems are you trying to solve with NoSQL (e.g., performance bottlenecks, schema rigidity, scalability limits)?
    *   What are the key requirements for the new database (e.g., consistency model, query patterns, data volume, latency)?

2.  **Analyze Current Data and Access Patterns:**
    *   **Schema Review:** Document the existing MariaDB schema, including tables, relationships, indexes, and data types.
    *   **Query Analysis:** Identify frequently executed queries, their complexity, and the data they access. This is crucial for designing the NoSQL data model.
    *   **Data Volume & Growth:** Estimate current and projected data sizes and transaction rates.

3.  **Choose the Right NoSQL Database:**
    *   Based on your objectives and data analysis, select the most suitable NoSQL type and specific database product:
        *   **Document Databases (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase):** Ideal for semi-structured data, flexible schemas, and hierarchical data. Good for content management, catalogs, user profiles.
        *   **Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB):** Best for simple, high-speed read/write operations on small data items. Good for caching, session management, leaderboards.
        *   **Column-Family Databases (e.g., Cassandra, HBase):** Suited for large-scale data with high write throughput and time-series data. Good for IoT, analytics, fraud detection.
        *   **Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune):** Optimized for highly connected data and complex relationship queries. Good for social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection.
    *   **Considerations:** Licensing, community support, cloud integration, operational overhead, existing team expertise.

4.  **NoSQL Data Modeling:**
    *   **Denormalization:** Embrace denormalization where appropriate to optimize for read performance and reduce joins (which are often absent or limited in NoSQL).
    *   **Embedding vs. Referencing:** Decide whether to embed related data within a single document/record or reference it across multiple. This depends on access patterns and data size.
    *   **Sharding/Partitioning Strategy:** Plan how data will be distributed across nodes for scalability and performance.

### Phase 2: Development and Data Migration

1.  **Set Up NoSQL Environment:**
    *   Provision and configure the chosen NoSQL database instances (local, cloud, or on-premise).
    *   Set up monitoring, backups, and security.

2.  **Develop Data Migration Tools/Scripts (ETL):**
    *   **Extraction:** Write scripts to extract data from MariaDB.
    *   **Transformation:** Implement logic to transform the relational data into the new NoSQL data model. This is often the most complex step.
    *   **Loading:** Load the transformed data into the NoSQL database.
    *   **Incremental Migration:** Plan for how to handle data changes in MariaDB during the migration period (e.g., change data capture, dual writes).

3.  **Modify Application Code:**
    *   **Database Abstraction Layer:** If not already in place, consider introducing a database abstraction layer to minimize direct database coupling.
    *   **Driver Integration:** Replace MariaDB drivers and ORM (if used) with the appropriate NoSQL client libraries.
    *   **Query Rewriting:** Rewrite all database interaction logic to use the NoSQL query language and data access patterns. This will involve significant changes to business logic that interacts with the database.
    *   **Concurrency and Consistency:** Adapt application logic to handle the consistency model of the chosen NoSQL database (e.g., eventual consistency).

### Phase 3: Testing and Deployment

1.  **Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Update existing unit tests and create new ones for the NoSQL data access layer.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Verify that all application components interact correctly with the new NoSQL database.
    *   **Performance Testing:** Benchmark the new NoSQL implementation against the MariaDB baseline. Test read/write throughput, latency, and scalability under load.
    *   **Data Integrity Tests:** Crucially, verify that data migrated correctly and that new data is consistent.
    *   **Regression Testing:** Ensure existing functionalities are not broken.

2.  **Deployment Strategy (Phased Approach Recommended):**
    *   **Dual Write (Strangler Fig Pattern):**
        *   Write new data to both MariaDB and NoSQL.
        *   Read from MariaDB initially.
        *   Gradually shift read traffic to NoSQL.
        *   Once all reads are from NoSQL, stop writing to MariaDB.
        *   This allows for a gradual transition and easy rollback.
    *   **Big Bang (Less Recommended for Critical Systems):**
        *   Migrate all data at once during a planned downtime.
        *   Switch the application entirely to NoSQL.
        *   Higher risk but faster transition if successful.

3.  **Monitoring and Rollback Plan:**
    *   Implement robust monitoring for the NoSQL database and application performance.
    *   Have a clear rollback plan in case of unforeseen issues during or after deployment.

### Phase 4: Post-Migration

1.  **Optimization:**
    *   Continuously monitor performance and optimize queries, indexes (if applicable), and data models.
    *   Tune database configuration for optimal performance.

2.  **Decommission MariaDB:**
    *   Once confident in the NoSQL system, decommission the MariaDB instance.

3.  **Documentation and Training:**
    *   Update all relevant documentation.
    *   Train developers and operations teams on the new NoSQL database.
